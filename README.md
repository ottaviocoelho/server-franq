# Server Franq (Teste)

This project was created as part of a technical test for a Front-End Engineer position. This service is not part of the original test requirements; it was designed and implemented by me to fulfill certain needs:

[X] Split a generic endpoint into specific endpoints
[X] Maintain a cache to prevent multiple requests to this service from generating multiple requests to the external API
